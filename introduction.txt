Hello my name is Jason Sandoval. I am a junior studying Computer Science. I am still trying to see what fields I am interested in.
But I am interested in Software Engineering, Cyber Security, Data analytics, AI. Things I like to do outside of school are trying new foods, I am apart of the Triathlon Team, hiking, watching movies (star wars). I also have a dog her name is Luna and she is 
super adorable and she can be a diva sometimes.
